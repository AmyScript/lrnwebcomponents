    <!-- FIXME(polymer-modulizer):
        These imperative modules that innerHTML your HTML are
        a hacky way to be sure that any mixins in included style
        modules are ready before any elements that reference them are
        instantiated, otherwise the CSS @apply mixin polyfill won't be
        able to expand the underlying CSS custom properties.
        See: https://github.com/Polymer/polymer-modulizer/issues/154
