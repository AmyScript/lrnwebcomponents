        These imperative modules that innerHTML your HTML are
        a hacky way to be sure that any mixins in included style
        modules are ready before any elements that reference them are
        instantiated, otherwise the CSS @apply mixin polyfill won't be
        able to expand the underlying CSS custom properties.
        See: https://github.com/Polymer/polymer-modulizer/issues/154

            Nick Neddo refers to himself as the Organic Artist and has written a book by the same name. The Organic Artist by Nick Neddo is a pretty cool book and he shows you how to make ink pens (including a kind of marker), brushes, berry inks, paint from minerals (rocks), etc. It is an awesome book to read--and his website is interesting to.
